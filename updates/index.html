	<p>This is a place where I publish letters about my Fulbright year in India. I don't want to make you read that much in an email. Please feel free to share this page with whoever you think would be interested. I'll send an email each time I update, which will be infrequently. If that's something you don't want, <a href="mailto:cschmidt@risd.edu">email me</a>.</p>
	<p>Thanks for all your support!!</p>
