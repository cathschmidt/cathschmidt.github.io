<p>I am a graphic designer and novice type designer. I graduated from the <a href="http://risd.edu">Rhode Island School of Design</a> with a BFA in <a href="http://risd.gd">Graphic Design</a> in 2014. From August 2014 to May 2015 I was a Fulbright-Nehru Student Researcher studying type design for Devanagari at the <a href="http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/">Industrial Design Center</a> at IIT-Mumbai.</p>

<p>I've worked on projects for print and web, but I've also organized events, lead people, and written stuff.</p>

<p>I'm enchanted by typographic forms and compelled by the implications of typography as a vessel for communication. I'm curious about political and ethical questions around typography, particularly for non-latin scripts in the digital age.</p>

<p>My work has been published in <a href="http://drawdown.bigcartel.com/product/fff-filipino-folk-foundry">Filipino Folk Foundry</a> by <a href="http://officeocd.com/">Hardworking Goodlooking</a> and <a href="http://htmloutput.risd.gd/">for / with / in</a> by <a href="http://thedesignoffice.org/">The Design Office</a>.</p>

<p>During my time at RISD I was the president of <a href="http://risd.steamwith.us">RISD STEAM</a>, a student group founded by <a href="http://sarahpease.com">Sarah Pease</a> seeking to reimagine the role of the artist in society via combining Art with STEM. I'm proud to say the organizaton has grown to include groups at <a href="http://brown.steamwith.us">Brown</a>, <a href="http://mit.steamwith.us">MIT</a>, and <a href="http://yale.steawmwith.us">Yale</a>.</p>

<p>I speak Spanish and Hindi conversationally, and French fluently.</p>
