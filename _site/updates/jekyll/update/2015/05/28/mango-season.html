<h2>Mango Season</h2>

<p>Dear Friends and Family,</p>

<p>The Alphonso Mango is a perfect product of nature. It smells unimaginable, delectably synthetic, a fruit conceived by Willy Wonka. Its flesh is the consistency of sorbet. Cut open, it forms the paisley shape. I gnaw at the pit over the sink. It is heavenly.</p>

<p>Mango season is summer and summer is hot. I work cross-legged on the floor with the curtains shut and the fan spinning frantically. "It's soooooooooo hoooooot," my roommates moan through the apartment clad in wicking sportswear. I usually stay inside until night time. I plug away on the font and meet my professor every other week. I take two showers a day or none if I've given up. The mosquitoes seem to have given up. They will be resurrected with monsoon.</p>

<p>We went to watch a cricket game, the fast kind. We take the train and meet friends at a proper dive bar. It's light outside but the bar is dim, illuminated only by a big T.V. We down a watery pilsner and some masala peanuts (peanuts, chopped cucumber, tomato, and red onion, cilantro, salt and spices and lime). The Mumbai Indians play the Delhi Daredevils. The Indians defend for twenty overs, roughly equivalent to innings in baseball, then they play offense for the next twenty. They play quickly, but twenty overs still takes two hours and the circular pitch makes the game feel rather futile. Sellers weave through our knees with melted ice cream and warm Pepsi. By ten I'm dehydrated and sticky and very uncurious about where this game is going. At halftime I leave to the protests of our friends &mdash; we're missing the best part!</p>

<p>But this is at the end of my time here. In December after revision and reading I learned exactly what the project would be about. I began to photograph train signs. In the Mumbai Metro the security guards are up in arms about my big camera. They carry large guns and I don't want to upset them. Photography is prohibited. I wait for the station manager to clear this all up. He gives me the name of a branding chief I contact later to learn about how the signs were made. But no dice on the photography. No problem — past security I take my sign photos furtively and photograph the whole system within the afternoon.</p>

<p>This branding chief tells me some very salient things but says that the English signs are set in a custom Helvetica. They are not set in a custom Helvetica. They are set in Univers.</p>

<p>In December my friend Rebecca invites me to go with her to a paper making workshop in Pondicherry, specifically Auroville. Pondicherry is a few hours north of Chennai and was occupied by France. Naturally it is very quaint. We stay with a friend of a friend's aunt in the French quarter. Auroville is a utopian society in the jungle founded maybe forty years ago. We go to Auroville by rickshaw for the three days of the workshop.</p>

<p>The workshop is at a small paper mill called Auroville Papers run by a Frenchman named Henri. Henri is tall, bearded, bespectacled, thin as a rail with his clothes hanging off of him. He lopes around the mill giving orders in Tamil, a paper Prospero. He came to Auroville in the seventies and I can't imagine he has left India since I was born. All of the paper at the mill is hand-made using waste cotton and plant fibers grown on site. The other workshop participants are an Indian architecture student and an Italian resident of Auroville. We cut up papyrus (pap-EE-roos) into a bucket to brew in a soda concoction. We beat the pulp by hand with wooden rods. I learn what mulberry looks like. It's a great workshop!</p>

<p>For Christmas I go to the Philippines with Alex and have my fill of pork and beef products. I love the Philippines but I'm sad to be away from my family. I am aware for the first time that the Philippines was, in fact, a colony of the United States. It was never phrased that way in my history books. Alex's mom talks to me about the imperialism of my grant program, all very sweetly, matter-of-factly, the participant of a U.S. exchange program herself. She's not wrong.</p>

<p>In January my hair is horribly thin so I cut it all off. This solves my problem and I never think about my falling hair again.</p> 

<p>The girls and I run the Mumbai Marathon (I run the half, they run the full). Forty thousand runners. Dad comes to visit and finds me mid-way through the course! He runs with me to the finish line. I make Dad try my favorite Mumbai food, pav bhaji, and I make him sick. Sorry Dad!!</p>

<p>I photograph perhaps half of the train signs of the Mumbai local rail system. This is a feat. In winter it is cool but not enough to make the task pleasant. I break it up over a few weeks. After the photographs are collected I make a visual analysis but I have never done anything quite like this before. I try to be insightful without reaching. I prepare a presentation for three different audiences: the Berkley Alumni Club of Mumbai, the Fulbright regional conference in Hyderabad, and Typoday, India's annual typography conference. I also begin sketching for the font. In late February we go on a leisurely trip to Kerala on our way to the Fulbright conference, in March.</p>

<p>The Fulbright conference is refreshing and I am impressed by many of the presenters. The majority of projects are on public health and anthropology. There is a very memorable presentation about an eye hospital in Tamil Nadu which performs one thousand cataract surgeries per day (with the same rates of infection we have in the States, and a fraction of the medical waste). I am placed in a grab-bag panel titled "Study of India" with a Sanskrit scholar, a medieval historian, and a tabla (drum) player. The audience seems to understand what I do and why I do it which is all I ask. Attendees approach me afterward with questions and I am really flattered.</p>

<p>I return home to Mumbai and it's Holi, the oft-photographed festival of powdered color. I'm too shy to play with the kids outside. I prepare for a high-stakes presentation at Typoday, which is hosted at my university this year. Last-minute I'm given a ten-minute speaking slot. I'm so nervous. It's my first typography conference and I feel so very green. But the event is enthusiastic, fascinating, heart-felt; I meet a lot of type designers whom I've been following for some time. I say, "I know you from Twitter," more than once. There are projects about Sinhala, Japanese, Malay, Sanskrit, and on and on. I feel very at home and the audience is receptive. After this conference I think I could be a type designer. No, should be.</p>

<p>At the end of March my family comes to visit and we travel in Rajasthan on bumpy roads. Dad plans a stellar itinerary which includes Delhi, Agra, Ranthambore, Jaipur, Jaisalmer (quite the drive), a leopard camp, and Udaipur. We end in Mumbai. I find my Hindi coming more naturally now, and out in the sticks people humor me. To have my family come and see what I see, to travel through this country together, is a delight. My parents are so game. They brave heat and smells and dust. Fondly they tell me it's genetic, and retell the story of my mother, who at twenty-two left the country herself for another hot place. In the Dominican Republic she taught school, rode a scooter (terrifying), stopped wearing pantyhose and soaked her vegetables in clorox.</p>

<p>The final weeks of the grant come too fast. I learn FontLab and get to work. I come to my university often. My advisor has me sit in on classes in calligraphy and typography in the Visual Communications masters program. The students are my age and very welcoming. They have come to IIT from all over the country and ask me about RISD and life in the U.S. They include me in their jokes and laugh easily at mine. Having them critique my font is surreal, a familiar exercise in a new place with new peers. How delighted I am with this community I've inserted myself into, how lucky I am for their support, feedback, chai.</p>

<p>The font comes naturally, a project that for once progresses in a measured way. It is nubby and clumsy. It is taken from painted Devanagari signs of the local rail, to be seen at big sizes. If Mumbai ever needs signage typography that looks more closely at the past instead of trying to escape it, this font will be there. Tentatively I'm calling it "Railway". My professor is very kind and says that it is work beyond my years — though, to be fair, he keeps forgetting how old I am. It's not finished, but it's close.</p>

<p>Printing out individual letters of the font for each review, my printer asks me if I'm teaching Hindi. No, I say. Am I learning Hindi? Yes, I say.</p>

<p>To leave this city breaks my heart. I book my flight out. I extend my foreign residence permit for ten more days, waiting in some colonial hangover establishment by St Xaviers with these other foreigners in various states of coming and going. We pack up the house and look out from the balconies to survey the neighborhood, my neighborhood. My fruit guy, my print guy, my lunch spot, my egg man, none of them know it's the last time I will see them but I do.</p> 

<p>I take a last trip to Sri Lanka, a country that has less in common with India than I thought. I am quizzed by immigration officers, I am conveyed on trains and buses, I find the beach and lie down. The country is beautiful and the people are smiley. In the night, beneath a small moon, I follow a man who takes us on the beach to sea turtles laying eggs. He shines a red light on one. She is huge. She weighs three hundred pounds and has come from the sea to the very edge of the beach, digging as though swimming, flippers covering many golf ball eggs. She digs her way back to the water in a tired way. She is consumed by the surf in a gratifying moment.</p>

<p>In this way I leave India. I think these transitions come naturally to me. I am sad to go but relish the going, the interstitial moment. What this year was good for, what it all means, these are hard questions that I can answer if you ask. But their real answer is impossible to find, as though we could isolate my life with and without India. No, I am simply a little different, as we all are in each season. I have learned a lot but mostly that I don't know anything. I have  been places and seen things and acquired more freckles. I was so heavy with anxiety about the next step, but now that I'm here I feel weightless, ready.</p>

<p>But I can tell you this: your love and support keeps me going. They way you have reached out, in ways big and small, while I've been away has been touching. Thank you for making yourselves available to me, for emailing and calling, liking and texting and skyping. In a potentially lonely situation you have made me feel connected.</p>

<p>I'll be back in the U.S. on June 8, and I hope I'll see you soon.</p>
<p>Much love,</br>
Catherine</p>
