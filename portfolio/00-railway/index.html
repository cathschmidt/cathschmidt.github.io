<p>Between August 2014 and May 2015 I was a Fulbright-Nehru Student Researcher studying type design for Devanagari at the <a href="http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/">Industrial Design Center (IDC)</a> at IIT-Mumbai, which is well known for type design and typographic research. This Devanagari typeface, inspired by handpainted signs of the Mumbai local rail, was the outcome of my project.</p>

<p>Before starting the font I made a visual analysis of signage typography for Mumbai's local train systems. I was curious about the contrast between the Mumbai Metro's monolinear, airport-esque signage and the local rail's hand-painted modulated signs. Though the Metro is newer than the local rail, the systems are contemporaries. New signs continue to be painted a modulated style on the local rail.</p>

<p>I was curious about possible ideologies or semiologies conveyed through these contrasting signage systems. Though coeval, the Metro signs are in keeping with a vision of the future for Mumbai, while the local rail signs evoke the past. Which formal charactaristics of the letters of each signage system give the impression of modernity or tradition, newness or familiarity &mdash; and why? I gave a presentation about my research at the international <a href="http://www.typoday.in/2015/index.html">Typoday conference</a> in March.</p>

<p>In response to this inquiry, I made a typeface. Tentatively named Railway, this typeface offers an alternative to the monolinear Devanagari typefaces used in the city's digitally-made signage, while hopefully retaining the character of the city. This high-contrast display face features angular cuts and open knots, and mimicks the heavy weight of much of the city's hand-painted signage.</p>
<p>This typeface is a work in progress. It was made under the guidance of Professor G.V. Sreekumar and Dr Girish Dalvi, faculty at IDC.</p>
