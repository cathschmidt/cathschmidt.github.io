<p>As a designer I'm interested in where I fit in the world. I've found that STEAM, which is adding Art to Science Technology Engineering and Math, is a helpful way to envision how artists and designers could occupy our cultural imagination. This year I'm the president of RISD's STEAM <a href="http://steamwith.us">student group</a>.</p>

<p>I started by creating an identity for STEAM at RISD and beyond. I wanted something that could be drawn by hand and by people who might not have access or experience with Adobe software. I used a pentagon to represent the five initials of STEAM:</p>

<p>But I needed something customizable to a growing group of schools and, again, easy to replicate.</p>

<p>With a low-key identity established, I made a website with the help of <a href="http://ltwp.net/â€Ž" target="_blank">Lukas WinklerPrins</a> and <a href="http://ryanflomerfelt.com" target="_blank">Ryan Flomerfelt Mather</a>.

<p>From there I've made a variety of print and digital projects for the STEAM group, and hopefully helped facilitate others to make graphic work around STEAM too.</p>

<p>I made a zine about our group to distribute at the New York Art Book Fair.</p>

<p>Posters for events held on campus, notably <a href="http://steamwith.us/hc">Human + Computer</a>, a workshop series we facilitated this winter.</p>

<p>To document what we do and share it with others, I started catalogue to be published quarterly. If you'd like a copy, <a href="mailto:cschmidt@risd.edu">let me know</a>.</p>
