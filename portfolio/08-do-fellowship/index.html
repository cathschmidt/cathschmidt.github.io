<p>A website which prints to an 11 x 17 poster created to announce the Design Office summer fellowship. The announcement is the same &mdash; it just has two different outputs. On scroll the sun skews, so you can choose which version of the poster you'd like to print. Made in collaboration with <a href="http://johncaserta.com/">John Caserta</a>. See the <a href="http://thedesignoffice.org/fellowship">site</a>.</p>
