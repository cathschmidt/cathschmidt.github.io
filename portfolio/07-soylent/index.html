<p><a href="www.soylent.com" target="_blank">Soylent</a> is a liquid food alternative created by former bro-grammers. Soylent saves time cooking, preparing, and consuming food while offering balanced nutrition. I proposed this tonge-in-cheek brand identity for class (about a year before <a href="http://okfoc.us">OkFocus</a> got a hold of it).</p>

<p>Through black and white graphics and rounded type, the brand identity acknowledges the goofiness of the product. It rejects "scienciness" in favor of humor to the make the product more appealing, an inside joke among Soylent fans.</p>
