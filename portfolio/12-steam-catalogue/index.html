<p>The first catalogue of events, essays, and workshops by the RISD and Brown <a href="http://steamwith.us" target="_blank">STEAM</a> (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) student groups. The catalogue serves as both an archival document and a showcase for those interested in STEAM.</p><p>I'm proud to say that the group has continued the tradition. The latest catalogue is <a href="http://steamwith.us/content/catalogue/four/" target="_blank">Catalogue Four</a>.</p>
