<p>This process book documents projects completed for my Color class at RISD. Because color is relative, I explored the interaction of color by eschewing a neutral ground for the work. I added a textured background to add interest to many spreads of solid color.</p> 

<p>My face is on the book to identify it as my work. The book was printed with an inkjet printer and hand-bound.</p>
