<p>Between August 2014 and May 2015 I was a Fulbright-Nehru Student Researcher studying type design for Devanagari at the <a href="http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/">Industrial Design Center (IDC)</a> at IIT-Mumbai, which is well known for type design and typographic research. A <a href="/portfolio/01-railway">Devanagari typeface</a>, inspired by handpainted signs of the Mumbai local rail, was the outcome of my project.</p>

<p>Before starting the font I made a visual analysis of signage typography for Mumbai's local train systems. I was curious about the contrast between the Mumbai Metro's monolinear, airport-esque signage and the local rail's hand-painted modulated signs. Though the Metro is newer than the local rail, the systems are contemporaries. New signs continue to be painted a modulated style on the local rail.</p>

<p>I was curious about possible ideologies or semiologies conveyed through these contrasting signage systems. Though coeval, the Metro signs are in keeping with a vision of the future for Mumbai, while the local rail signs evoke the past. Which formal charactaristics of the letters of each signage system give the impression of modernity or tradition, newness or familiarity &mdash; and why? I gave a presentation about my research at the international <a href="http://www.typoday.in/2015/index.html">Typoday conference</a> in March.</p>

<p>This poster was created for my presentation at the conference. The poster illustrates the four main observations of a visual analysis comparing the signs of the Mumbai Metro to those of the local rail. The typography of the signs of the Mumbai Metro is monolinear, branded, digital, and authored, as opposed to the rail signs which are modulated, unbranded, analog, and unauthored. The  graphic symbolizes the roundel of a Metro sign split open.</p>
