<p>LoveGov.com, a start-up founded by recent Brown University graduates, seeks to make the workings of government accessible and engaging to young adults. Users are matched to politicians and causes and can follow .</p>
<p>As Lead Designer, I was in charge of the interactions and visual design of the site. I guided the founders through the process of selecting an identity &mdash; including a name &mdash; and helped them hone their messaging before helping them build their product.</p>
<p>I had to find a way to make legislative data both appealing and understandible. I designed a system of icons to illustrate different voter issues. Typographic and visual heirarchy were imperative for the success of the site. I made high-res mockups and worked with our team to conceive and implement new features. I hired another designer, <a href="http://callil.com">Callil</a>, to help with wireframing and other design tasks.</p>
