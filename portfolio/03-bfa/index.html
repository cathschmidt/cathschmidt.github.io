<p>Brothers from Another, or <a href="http://www.bfamag.com/">BFA</a>, and I go way back. Since their inception I've done album covers and posters for the Seattle-based hip-hop trio.</p>

<p>Last summer they approached me to design a logo for the group. Inspired by lettering on vintage baseball jerseys, the group wanted something that would work with a fuzzed out, summer-y aesthetic. I love the way they use the logo in videos, promotional photos, and merchandise.</p>
