<p>Jungle is a text face designed for a fictional centennial edition of Upton Sinclair's <i>The Jungle</i>. The typeface is inspired by early 20th century ionic and clarendon types like Century and Ionic no. 5. It features dramatic ball terminals, slight wedge serifs, short decenders, and a very long em dash. The proportions were selected for optimum legibility.</p>
