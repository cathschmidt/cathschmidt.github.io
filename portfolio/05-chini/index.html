<p>"Chini" means sugar in Hindi. Chini is a Devanagari and Latin display typeface (in progress) that I made as a part of my degree project at RISD. Chini was my first attempt at a Devanagari typeface.</p>

<p>Chini was inspired round-brush painted signs common in parts of north India. It's meant to be used in display sizes, ideally for the web. Now that I know more about designing type for Devanagari, I look forward to adjusting this font.</p>

<p>This project was featured in <a href="http://drawdown.bigcartel.com/product/fff-filipino-folk-foundry">Filipino Folk Foundry</a> by <a href="http://officeocd.com/">Hardworking Goodlooking</a>, available through Draw Down books.</p>

<p>Below is a short video I made to present the project to my classmates.</p>
