<p>I made a book for the RISD class of 1963 50th reniunion as a part of my internship under <a href="http://micahbarrett.info/" target="_blank">Micah Barrett</a> for RISD Media, RISD's PR arm. The book is inspired by the 1963 yearbook, which dutifully captured every student in his or her environment. The book includes a mix of photos from the yearbook and alumni-submited photos, plus a blurb from each alumn. To create unity between the old photos and the new ones (submitted by email in many resolutions...), I presented the photos in a halftone pattern. A current photo of each alumn is overlayed over his or her yearbook photo.</p>
<p>The books are laster printed on Classic Crest paper and bound with rubber band.</p>
