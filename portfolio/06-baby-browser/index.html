<p>BabyBrowser is a tiny browser written in Java. Using Java's charmingly outdated Swing library, it's essentially a frame that points to a URL. Sometimes it can parse HTML &amp; CSS, and sometimes it can't. BabyBrowser questions the ubiquity and completeness of the web. It highlights the fact that the web as we know it is simply a set of agreed-upon standards. BabyBrowser shows that potentially there are different ways to use and see the internet.</p>
<p>BabyBrowser was created for the "HTML-Output" course taught by <a href="http://johncaserta.com/">John Caserta</a>. It is featured in <a href="http://htmloutput.risd.gd/">for / with / in</a> which is distributed by Draw Down books.</p>
