<p><a href="http://html-output.risd.gd">for / with / in</a>, a project formally known as "html-output", is a website which prints to a <a href="http://drawdown.bigcartel.com/product/for-with-in-graphic-design-for-with-and-in-the-browser">book</a> using the browser's print function. The site presents a series of graphic design and code experiments about using the browser as a tool for graphic design. I worked collaboratively with a group of students and <a href="http://johncaserta.com">John Caserta</a> to assemble the projects into a website and a book which would print from the browser.</p>
<p>Specifically I worked on the typography and layout of the site. The book itself was laid out via print stylesheets for CSS.</p>
<p>The book-making aspect of the website was made possible by <a href="http://brooks.io/">Evan Brooks</a> via an amazing library called <a href="http://htmloutput.risd.gd/project-brooks-bindery/">bindery.js</a>.</p>
