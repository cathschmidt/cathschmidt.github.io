<p>From fall of 2013 to spring of 2014, I was the designer for the <a href="http://acp.risd.edu/" target="_blank">Academic Commons Program</a>. The program gave faculty and graduate students grants to craft interdisciplanary courses and projects to enrich the undergraduate experience at RISD.</p>
<p>This poster was inspired by the typographic identity created by <a href="http://andrew.lu" target="_blank">Andrew Lu</a>. Using only typography, the many alternates of the identity, and the RISD seal, the poster announces a call for proposals for the program. The poster is laser printed on heavyweight paper. It can be displayed at 11x17 size or cut up into mailbox-sized fliers.</p>
