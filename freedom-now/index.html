				<p>In the summer of 2002, six students from Brown University and Tougaloo College joined a group of faculty and staff from each campus to conduct research in the Tougaloo College Archives. The project lasted 10 weeks; two at Brown in Providence, Rhode Island and eight at Tougaloo in Jackson, Mississippi. The students chose documents to include in an on-line database and wrote essays based on those documents. You can read about the participants, or learn more about the research process by going to the section on "Archives."</p></article>
